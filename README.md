__Abstract__  

Boserup cycles of population growth and intensification are typically applied to existing agricultural populations, but they can also be used to study the origins and evolution of those agricultural systems, too. In an archaeological context, of course, this comes with many challenges, notably: (1) estimating the spatial extent of arable land, (2) accommodating interactions at multiple spatial scales, and (3) handling inconsistencies in the definition of archaeological sites (the old lumping vs splitting problem). One relatively intuitive way to address these issues is to define larger aggregations of archaeological materials thought to represent complex social units like communities. Here we demonstrate a simple algorithm to do that, one designed somewhat narrowly to identify *dispersed* farming communities. Our algorithm is analogous to that used to define core-based statistical areas for the US census, though instead of modern metropolitan areas, we rely on community *centers* (or areas of known and persistent interaction between unrelated individuals). We provide examples of our algorithm by applying it to data drawn from the Village Ecodynamics Project. Together, these data provide a comprehensive, high resolution record of prehistoric maize farming in the Four Corners region of the North American Southwest.
