__Session:__ "On the Margins: Understanding the Centre-Periphery Interaction during the Transition to Farming [PaM]"

__Title:__ "A core-periphery approach to defining community boundaries"

__Authors:__ K. Blake Vernon and Scott Ortman

__Abstract__  

Boserup cycles of population growth and intensification (decreasing labor productivity and increasing land productivity) are typically applied to existing agricultural populations, but they can also be used to study the origins and evolution of those agricultural systems, too. In an archaeological context, of course, this comes with many challenges, notably: (1) estimating the spatial extent of agricultural land, (2) accommodating interactions at multiple spatial scales, and (3) handling inconsistencies in the definition of archaeological sites (the old lumping vs splitting problem). One relatively intuitive way to address these issues is to define larger aggregations of archaeological materials thought to represent complex social units like communities. Here we demonstrate a simple algorithm to do that, one designed narrowly to identify *dispersed* farming communities. Our algorithm is analogous to that used to define core-based statistical areas for the US census, though instead of modern metropolitan areas, we rely on community *centers* (or areas of known and persistent interaction between unrelated individuals). We provide examples of our algorithm by applying it to data drawn from the Village Ecodynamics Project. Together, these data provide a comprehensive, high resolution record of prehistoric maize farming in the Four Corners region of the North American Southwest.

...the final product came to deviate substantially from what was originally proposed. My excuse for this is that I severely underestimated how long it would take to get the necessary data together (some people will just never learn). For reference, here is what I originally submitted:

__Title:__ "Maize at the margins: Exploring core-periphery interactions and the spread of the Fremont""
 
__Abstract__

The spread of farming almost always involves interactions between a core farming population and a peripheral hunter-gatherer population. Here, we seek to explore those interactions directly, focusing on how they structure the spread of farming. Specifically, we seek to answer the following questions (i) Where do core farming areas tend to occur and why do they occur there? and (ii) How does the structure of peripheral populations affect their distribution? It remains a challenge, however, to incorporate such interactions into a statistical model. Fortunately, a lot of good work has been done on similar problems in ecology, particularly through the application of space-time point process or species distribution models that are fit using a Bayesian method known as Integrated Nested Laplace Approximation (INLA). As a test case, we use archaeological populations of mixed hunter-gatherers and maize farmers known collectively as "the Fremont" who lived at the far northern periphery of maize agriculture in western North America, in an area encompassing much of the modern state of Utah north of the Virgin and Colorado Rivers, from roughly 2000 to 700 years BP.
